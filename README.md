 ## 👋 Hi, I'm Avril

I’m a **Data Scientist and Machine Learning Practitioner** with a distinction in the **Code First Girls Data Science Nano Degree** and a strong professional background in healthcare and property.

My mission is to bridge the gap between **clinical understanding and data-driven insight** - using analytics and AI to improve outcomes, optimise operations, and support evidence-based decision making.

I also have a strong background in **property and investment**, with a deep-seated interest in the application of machine learning and A.I tools to support and enhance deal sourcing and analysis. 

I’ve applied my skills across **financial analytics, property prediction, and healthcare data projects**, combining **Python, SQL, scikit-learn, Power BI, and Tableau** to uncover patterns that drive smarter action.

🏥 **My healthcare background**
Working within multidisciplinary healthcare environments taught me how to handle sensitive data responsibly, interpret complex datasets, and translate results for both technical and non-technical audiences. That experience now shapes my data science practice — from cleaning and validating data to communicating findings that truly matter.

🧠 **Key strengths**
- End-to-end data analysis: from raw data to insights and dashboards 
- Predictive modelling and feature engineering using Python & scikit-learn 
- Database querying, joins, and optimisation with SQL 
- Data storytelling and visualisation with Tableau & Power BI 
- Commitment to privacy, ethics, and high data quality standards 

🎯 **Current Focus:** Building reproducible ML pipelines and exploring AI applications in health analytics and operations.

📚 **Certification:** Code First Girls Data Science Nano Degree – *Distinction* , BSc(HON)Nursing with Registration (King's College London)
